            <h1>Physics of Optics and Light</h1>
            <p>
                Optics and light physics explores light's interaction with
                matter, serving as the primary tool for observing the universe
                and driving critical advancements in technology, medicine, and
                biology. Its principles are foundational for our understanding
                of fundamental phenomena from microcosms to macrocosms.

                <h2>The Nature of Light</h2>
                <p>
                    Light is a transverse, electromagnetic wave that can be seen
                    by the typical human. The wave nature of light was first
                    illustrated through experiments on diffraction and
                    interference. Like all electromagnetic waves, light can
                    travel through a vacuum. The transverse nature of light can
                    be demonstrated through polarization.

                <h2>Geometric Optics</h2>
                <p>
                    Geometrical optics describes light propagation in terms of
                    rays, which is useful in approximating the paths along which
                    light propagates in certain classes of circumstances.
                    Geometrical optics does not account for certain optical
                    effects such as diffraction and interference.

                <h2>Physical Optics</h2>
                <p>
                    Physical optics delves into the wave nature of light,
                    explaining phenomena like interference and diffraction that
                    geometric optics cannot. It explores how light behaves as
                    waves, revealing the intricate patterns and interactions
                    that arise from its inherent wave-like properties
