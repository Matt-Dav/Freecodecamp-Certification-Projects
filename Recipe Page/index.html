                            cups. I used a combination of cheddar, Monterey jack

                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Preheat oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (to keep
                            quesadillas warm while cooking batches).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large non-stick
                            frying pan (about a 10-inch or 12-inch pan) over
                            medium heat. Add ground beef, chili powder, chipotle
                            pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder,
                            salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper (if using).
                            Cook, breaking the ground beef into small pieces and
                            stirring occasionally, until the ground beef is
                            fully cooked through (the ground beef should no
                            longer be pink and be browned all the way through),
                            about 8 to 10 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stir in tomato paste and beef stock/broth and cook
                            for 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove beef from the pan
                            and place into a bowl. If there is any excess
                            grease, drain/remove.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Distribute about 8 ounces (or 2 cups) of cheese
                            among all tortillas (on one side of them).
                            <strong>Note:</strong> Reserve the remaining 4
                            ounces of cheese (or 1 cup of cheese).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Distribute ground beef on top of cheese. Then
                            sprinkle remaining 1 cup (or 4 ounces) of cheese on
                            top of ground beef. Fold over each tortilla so it's
                            a half-moon shape.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To cook quesadillas, heat about 2 teaspoons of
                            vegetable oil in a large non-stick frying pan over
                            medium-low heat. Gently swirl the oil around the pan
                            to coat. <strong>Note:</strong> If you're using the
                            same pan that you used for cooking the ground beef,
                            just wipe out before greasing and cooking your
                            quesadillas. <strong>Note:</strong> Cook the
                            quesadillas in batches, two quesadillas at a time,
                            adding more oil to the pan between batches as
                            necessary.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place two quesadillas in the pan. Cook quesadillas
                            for about 2 minutes on one side.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Carefully flip quesadillas to the other side and
                            continue to cook for another 2 minutes or until
                            they're golden brown and crispy on the outside and
                            the cheese is melted inside (carefully watch to
                            ensure they don't burn). Transfer cooked quesadillas
                            to a sheet pan and place into your preheated oven to
                            keep warm while you are continuing to cook the
                            remaining quesadillas.
                        </li>
                        <li>Repeat process to cook remaining quesadillas.</li>
                        <li>
                            Once done, cut each quesadilla in half so you have
                            12 pieces. Great served with salsa, guacamole and/or
                            sour cream. Enjoy! <strong>Note:</strong> If you
                            have any leftovers, properly store them in an
                            airtight container in the refrigerator and use
                            within 3 to 4 days. Reheat before serving.
